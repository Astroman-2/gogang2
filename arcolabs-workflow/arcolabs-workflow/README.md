A clean TypeScript full-stack application demonstrating a multi-step workflow:  
**Draft → Performed → Approved** — with full audit logging and an Arcolabs-branded UI (light-blue panels, orange-gold actions).

## Setup & Running

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+  
- npm 9+

### 1. Backend

```bash
cd backend
npm install
npm run dev
```

Runs on **http://localhost:4000**

### 2. Frontend

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm start
```

Runs on **http://localhost:3000**

### 3. Run Tests

```bash
cd backend
npm test
```

## API Reference

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| `POST` | `/record` | Create a new record in `draft` state |
| `POST` | `/record/:id/perform` | Save form data → transition to `performed` |
| `POST` | `/record/:id/approve` | Lock record → transition to `approved` |
| `GET` | `/record/:id` | Return record + full audit log |

### State Machine

```
draft ──► performed ──► approved
           (locked)
```

Any out-of-order transition returns `HTTP 400` with a descriptive error.

## Enabling the Live Demo (GitHub Pages)

1. Push this repo to GitHub.
2. Go to **Settings → Pages**.
3. Set **Source** to `Deploy from a branch`, branch `main`, folder `/docs`.
4. Click **Save** — your demo will be live at `https://YOUR_USERNAME.github.io/arcolabs-workflow/` within ~60 seconds.
5. Update the two `YOUR_USERNAME` placeholders in this README.

The `docs/index.html` is a fully self-contained demo — no backend required. It simulates the entire API in-browser so interviewers can explore the workflow instantly.

## Assumptions

- A single dummy user (`John Doe`) is used for all audit log entries — authentication is out of scope.
- `state_code` is a free-form string chosen from a dropdown that can be extended at runtime.
- Transitions are **strictly linear**: `draft → performed → approved`. Any other transition returns HTTP 400.
- The SQLite database file (`database.sqlite`) is auto-created on first run and persists between restarts.

---

## Design Notes

1. **Strict State Machine** — All transitions are enforced at the API level. Attempting to approve a draft record returns `400` with a clear error, regardless of frontend behaviour. The frontend mirrors this by only showing the relevant action button for each state.

2. **Persistent SQLite Storage** — SQLite was chosen over in-memory storage so records and audit logs survive server restarts without the reviewer needing to configure a separate database. The schema initialises automatically on server start.

3. **Full Before/After Audit Trail** — Every transition stores `before_json` and `after_json` snapshots of the record's `data` field. The frontend renders these in an expandable log panel so any change is fully traceable.

4. **Arcolabs Design System** — The UI uses a custom CSS design system built around a light-blue panel palette (`#1562a8` primary) and an orange-gold action colour (`#e07d08`). Typography pairs `Syne` (headings) with `DM Sans` (body) for a distinctive, professional feel consistent with the Arcolabs brand.

5. **Error Resilience + UX Polish** — All API calls are wrapped in try/catch. Failures surface in a dismissable notification banner (top-right) rather than silent failures. Buttons disable with a loading spinner during in-flight requests to prevent duplicate submissions. After approval, all fields and actions are disabled with a clear lock banner.
